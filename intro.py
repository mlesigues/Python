#introduction to python

#print function = it prints anything you put on inside the parentheses. Ex:
print ("Hello, World")
print ("Hello, my name is Ate Marielle")

#indentation is very important. It tells the compiler which block of codes belong together, if you misplace/skip an indentation, your code might cause an error or it might do what you tell it to do. Ex:
def my_function():
  print("this is the my_function") 

my_function()

#def my_function2():
#print("this is my_function2")
